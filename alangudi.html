<p>Location:Kumbakonam - Mannargudi - Adirampattinam Rd, SKR Nagar, Thiruvonamangalam, Tamil Nadu 612801</p>
<p>Main god:Lord Hanuman</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>Like every temple of India, the Alangudi Temple also has a mythological significance with ancient Hindu texts and beliefs. The story of how Lord Shiva ingested the poison of the snake Vasuki that he spat out while he was being used by gods and demons to churn the ocean to retrieve the nectar of immortality is known by many. As per the myth, Vasuki's poison would kill anyone on earth, hell or heaven if they come in touch. So, Lord Shiva took it himself to save the three worlds and thus was named 'Abathsahayeswarar' which in Tamil means 'rescuer'.</p>
